## Find the invisible Lars

A game inspired by "find the invisible cow": http://findtheinvisiblecow.com/

A great excuse to learn react.js and redux while making a fun 40th birthday present for my friend Lars. Easily adaptable for other names and pictures.

Currently doesn't work in Safari (since it does not use audio sprites)
